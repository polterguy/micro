## Misc classes

Micro contains several helper CSS classes for your convenience. We have already used some of these, 
such as the `bg` class, `shaded` class, and `air-inner` class. Below is a complete list of these 
extra classes.

* `shaded` - Adds shade to your widget/element
* `rounded` - Add rounded border to your widget/element
* `bg` - Adds a background to your widget. Which background, depends upon your skin
* `air` - Adds an additional margin around your widget
* `air-inner` - Adds additional padding to your widget
* `success` - Adds a green linear gradient to your widget
* `warning` - Adds a red linear gradient to your widget
* `left` - Left aligns text
* `right` - Right aligns text
* `center` - Centers text inside your widget
* `justify` - Justifies text
* `capitalize` - Transforms text such that the first character is Capitalized
* `hide` - Hides an element
* `button` - Makes for instance a hyperlink resemble a button in its appearance
* `jumbo-button` - Declares a large button, similar to the Desktop icons for your modules
* `select-panel` - Useful for creating a group of radio buttons, or for wrapping one or more checkboxes together

Notice, some of these CSS classes might have been overridden in your skin, depending upon which skin you are using.
It might be smart to check out your apps with all the skins from Micro, or at least all the skins you choose to
distribute your app with, to make sure it renders correctly with all possible skins the user might want to use.
