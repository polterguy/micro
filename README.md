# Micro

Micro is a microscopic CSS framework. It can be used stand alone, but is also a perfect companion 
with [Phosphorus Five](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive). It was created because of 
Bootstrap being too big, and other smaller framework not having the necessary features, and most 
of the CSS framework where too JavaScript centric - Including Bootstrapp CSS.
