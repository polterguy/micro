# Micro

Micro is a microscopic CSS and Ajax framework for Phosphorus Five. Micro builds upon a `container/row/col` structure,
and is such quite similar to Bootstrap CSS, but is significantly smaller in size, and created around the _"flexbox CSS model"_.
Micro is easily skinned, due to clever use of CSS variables.
