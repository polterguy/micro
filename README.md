# Micro

Micro is a microscopic CSS and Ajax framework. It can be used stand alone as a pure CSS framework, but is
also a perfect companion with [Phosphorus Five](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive).

Micro builds upon a `container/row/col` structure, and is such quite similar to Bootstrap CSS, but is
significantly smaller in size, and created around the _"flexbox CSS model"_. The last point makes it a
more modern CSS framework than Bootstrap. Micro is also extremely easy to skin, due to its clever use
of CSS variables, making it easy to modify any aspect of your HTML hierarchy, by simply creating
your own skin, and override a couple of CSS variables.

## Installation

Micro is automatically installed when you install Phosphorus Five.

## License

Micro is free and open source software, and licensed under the terms
of the Gnu Public License, version 3, in addition to that a proprietary enabling license is available for a fee.
