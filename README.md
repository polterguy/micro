# Micro

A microscopic Ajax widget library for [Phosphorus Five](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive).

Micro is a widget library created as an alternative to [System42](https://github.com/polterguy/system42)
for P5, which only includes the bare bones widgets you need when creating a Hyperlambda web application.
It features a tiny CSS framework, styling all the default HTML elements, and giving you responsive features,
such as a CSS grid, that will responsively change its size, according to your screen resolution.
