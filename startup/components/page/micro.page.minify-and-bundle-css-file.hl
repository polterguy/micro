/*
 * This event will minify and bundle all specified CSS files, and include the
 * minified and bundled CSS file on your page.
 *
 * All bundles created this way, will be stored in your
 * _"/common/documents/public/micro-css-cache/"_ folder, and all relative URLs
 * inside of the CSS file will be updated, and end up with an _"absolute path"_,
 * to avoid breaking relative references to for instance images and other
 * _"url()"_ type of references.
 *
 * The event will determine what filename to use for your bundle by doing a hash
 * on your filenames, and check if there already exists a cached bundled file,
 * before performing the actual bundling and minification - Implying that it
 * will only bundle and minify the same arguments it is given _once_, as long as
 * the order of your files are the same. This makes the event fairly fast in
 * terms of execution speed.
